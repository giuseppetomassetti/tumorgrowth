- a computational model obtained by an extension of the vertex model to a three-dimensional cell complex

Most of the observed effects can be captured by a simpler
model with polygonal cells, modified to include the effects of the apicobasal polarity and natural curvature of epithelia

We assume that the ==coarse-scale coordinate $\mathbf{x}$ takes continuous series of values== and displacements $u_{i}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})$ are continuous and differentiable in $\mathbf{x},$ while ==the fine scale coordinate $\mathbf{y}$ is discrete==. A multiple scale asymptotic expansion is employed to approximate the displacement
as
$$
u_{i}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, t)=u_{i}^{0}\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, t_{0}, t_{1}, t_{2}\right)+\varepsilon u_{i}^{1}\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, t_{0}, t_{1}, t_{2}\right)+\varepsilon^{2} u_{i}^{2}\left(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y}, t_{0}, t_{1}, t_{2}\right)+\cdots
$$
